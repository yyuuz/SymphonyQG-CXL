## Python Bindings (recommended)

### Bindings installation

* Install from sources in Python env (recommended version: 3.10):
```bash
apt-get install -y python-setuptools python-pip
cd python/
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh build.sh
```

### API description

* `symphonyqg.Index(index_type, metric, num_elements, dimension, degree_bound=32)` - intialize a non-constructed index
  * `index_type` defines the index type, currently only support 'QG'
  * `metric` defines the metric space, currently only support 'L2'
  * `num_elements` defines the number of elements
  * `dimension` defines the dimension of data vector
  * `degree_bound` defines the maximum out-degree of graph, must be a multiple of 32

`symphonyqg.Index` methods:
* `build_index(data, EF, num_iter=3, num_threads=ALL_THREDS)` - construct the index from `data`
    * `data` numpy array of vectors, `dtype=float32`, shape: `(num_elements, dimension)`
    * `EF` a parameter that controls the number of candidates during graph construction
    * `num_iter` number of interation for indexing, 3 by default
    * `num_threads` number of threads for indexing, use all threads in system by default
* `save(filename)` - save the `Index` to given path
* `load(filename)` - load the `Index` from given path, the loaded index must have same initialization parameters as the object
* `set_ef(EF)` - set the beam size to control time-accuracy trade-off of querying
* `search(query, k)` - search approximate `k` nearest neighbors for a given `query` 
    * `query` numpy array of a query vector, `dtype=float32`, shape: `(dimension,)` or `(1, dimension)`

### Example
For examples on real-world datasets, please refer to `./reproduce`
```python
import symphonyqg
import numpy as np

D = 64
N = 100000

# Random data
data = np.random.random((N, D)).astype('float32')

# Init index
index = symphonyqg.Index("QG", "L2", num_elements=N, dimension=D, degree_bound=32)

# Construct index
index.build_index(data, 200)

# Set beam size for querying
index.set_ef(100)

# Search query
K = 10
for i in range(10):
    query = data[i]
    knn = index.search(query, K)
    print(knn)

# Save index
index.save("./test.index")
del index

# Load index
index = symphonyqg.Index("QG", "L2", num_elements=N, dimension=D, degree_bound=32)
index.load("./test.index")
```


## Reproduce
* For downloading datasets and preprocessing, please refer to `./data/README.md`
* To build index and test query performance. please refer to `./reproduce/README.md` for details

## C++ examples
```bash
mkdir bin/ build/
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
* Currently, we only add an example for indexing. The APIs will be updated later.
